                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Energetic & easy-going dogs</li>
                        <li>Short coat</li>
                        <li>Variety of colours including black, brown & fawn</li>
                        <li>Average size = 25 - 36 cm</li>
                        <li>Average weight = 5 - 10 kg</li>
                        <li>Life expectancy = 12 - 15 years</li>
                        <li>Estimated monthly cost = Medium</li>
                        <li>Exercise needs = Medium</li>

                        <li>Sociability = Medium</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Jugs make great pets for first-time dog owners, because of their willingness to please and kind nature.</p>
                    <p>They are happy living in apartments and have fairly modest exercise requirements, so they are a great choice for people who live in the city.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Exercise</h3>
                            <p>Jugs are small in stature but big in energy. The Terrier part of their make-up means they love to get outside and explore, but their Pug genes mean that</p>
                            <p>they don’t need as much exercise as a Jack Russell. They need to be walked for around 45 minutes every day, which can be split into a shorter walk in</p>
                            <p>the morning and a longer, more interesting walk in the evening</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Ideal Home environment</h3>
                            <p>Jugs are loving dogs that make for a fantastic addition to the family. They are confident and tend to be very brave, but be careful that this feistiness is</p>
                            <p>kept in check and doesn’t lead to aggressive behaviour.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Training</h3>
                            <p>Jugs can be stubborn and will look to push the boundaries as they like to be dominant, but they are intelligent and will look to please their owner.</p>
                            <p>They don’t respond well to heavy-handed treatment or scolding, instead preferring positive reinforcement, praise and plenty of treats. Keep training</p>

                            <p>sessions short, reward-based and different each time.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Grooming</h3>
                            <p>A Jug’s coat is short, with some being rougher than others, depending on their genetics. Despite their short coat, they are quite heavy shedders, so if</p>
                            <p>you’re house proud, they might not be the best breed.</p>

                            <p>sessions short, reward-based and different each time.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Diet</h3>
                            <p>Your Jug will need a balanced diet rich in nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. It’s best to feed them complete dog food specially formulated for small</p>
                            <p>breeds to ensure that they are getting the right amounts of vitamins and nutrients.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Monthly cost</h2>
                    <p>When considering the lifetime cost of owning a Jug, remember to take into account the following costs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Food and diet</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Veterinary care</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Pet insurance</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Kennels or dog sitters</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Regular grooming costs</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        </li>
